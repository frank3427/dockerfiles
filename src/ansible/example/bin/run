# Run a container as an example

# ------------------------
#
# Workaround for the differences of .ssh/ permission and container user.
#
# Since 'docker' user's uid is 1000, which is differ from the host user(1001),
# even if you mount the ~/.ssh dir, 'docker' user is not allowed to read the keys.
# 
# There is another workaround which you run the container as a host user uid like...
#
# docker run -u $(id -u):$(id -g) ....
#
# But this didn't resolve user for ssh(No user exists for uid 1001) 
#
# So, it's bit ugly, but the below(copy from mounted ~/ssh dir to 
# ~/.ssh to make sure 'docker' user has right permission to read ~/.ssh)
# is only way to workout...
